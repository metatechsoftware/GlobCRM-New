## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Real-time chat/messaging | Not core to CRM value; integrate with Slack/Teams instead |
| Video calls | Integrate with external tools (Zoom, Teams) |
| AI/ML features (lead scoring, auto-categorization) | Requires large dataset, defer until data volume supports it |
| Third-party marketplace/plugins | Enormous maintenance overhead; webhooks + API sufficient |
| White-labeling | Single brand for v1; enterprise feature for later |
| Social media integration | APIs unreliable/expensive; link fields to social profiles instead |
| Full email client | Competing with Gmail/Outlook is futile; sync + send-from-CRM is the right scope |
| Visual workflow automation builder | High complexity; configurable triggers sufficient for v1 |
| Multi-language/i18n | English-only for v1; add when international expansion begins |
