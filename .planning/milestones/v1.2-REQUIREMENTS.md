# Requirements: GlobCRM v1.2 Connected Experience

**Defined:** 2026-02-20
**Core Value:** Every entity page is a dynamic, user-configurable table with rich custom fields, saved Views, and relational navigation — making GlobCRM the single workspace where teams manage all customer relationships and operational work.

## Future Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Entity Preview Enhancements

- **PREVIEW-14**: Inline entity references in feed content (entity names clickable within post text)
- **PREVIEW-15**: Cross-entity relationship map visualization

### Summary Tab Enhancements

- **SUMMARY-13**: Admin-customizable Summary tab layout per entity type
- **SUMMARY-14**: AI-generated record summaries with sentiment analysis
- **SUMMARY-15**: Sparkline trend charts (deal values, activity volume over 30/60/90 days)

### My Day Enhancements

- **MYDAY-13**: Configurable drag-and-drop widget layout (user-customizable My Day arrangement)
- **MYDAY-14**: Smart nudges / guided actions (rule-based: "3 deals closing this week", "5 overdue activities")

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Full entity editing in preview sidebar | Preview is read-only context; narrow panel creates poor editing UX |
| Nested preview-within-preview | One level of preview only; associations navigate to full detail |
| Custom fields in preview | Variable-length content makes preview unpredictable; core fields only |
| Preview panel resizing/docking | Fixed ~400px width; "Open full record" for more detail |
| Real-time updates while preview open | Refresh on re-open; stale-on-close pattern sufficient |
| Replacing existing left sidebar with MatSidenav | Current CSS sidebar works well; preview uses MatDrawer (right side only) |
| Editable fields on Summary tab | Summary is read-oriented; edit via Details tab |
| Full timeline on Summary tab | Summary shows 3-5 recent items; full timeline is its own tab |
| AI-generated summaries | Requires AI infrastructure; deferred to v2+ |
| Summary tab on Products | Insufficient connected data; add when Products have richer connections |
| Full FullCalendar embed on My Day | Heavyweight, redundant with Calendar page; use compact agenda instead |
| Admin-controlled My Day layouts | My Day is personal; admins control org dashboard only |
| Real-time polling on all My Day widgets | Refresh on load + manual refresh; SignalR for specific events only |
| External calendar embedding (Google/Outlook) | OAuth per provider adds complexity; show CRM activities only |
| Configurable widget layout (gridster drag-and-drop) | Deferred to MYDAY-13; My Day uses fixed layout for v1.2 |
