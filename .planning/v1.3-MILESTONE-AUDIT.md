# Milestone v1.3 "Platform & Polish" — Audit Report

**Audited:** 2026-02-22T13:30:00Z
**Status:** gaps_found
**Score:** 27/52 requirements satisfied

## Executive Summary

Milestone v1.3 spans 5 phases (27-31) covering localization, integration marketplace, Kanban boards, and quote PDF templates. Phases 27 (Localization Foundation) and 28 (String Extraction) are fully verified and passed. Phase 30 (Kanban Boards) is verified with 1 partial gap (KANB-11 entity click-to-preview — fix exists in uncommitted code). However, **Phases 29 and 31 have no VERIFICATION.md**, making all 24 requirements across those phases formally orphaned. Additionally, Phase 31 Plan 05 was never executed, leaving QTPL-04 (preview with real data) explicitly unsatisfied.

The integration checker confirmed all cross-phase wiring is correct — all API routes have callers, all auth guards are in place, and the Transloco i18n infrastructure works end-to-end. The gaps are primarily **formal verification gaps** (missing VERIFICATION.md files) rather than implementation gaps, except for QTPL-04 (truly incomplete) and KANB-11 (uncommitted fix).

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Status | Score | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|
| 27 — Localization Foundation | PASSED | 5/5 criteria, 7/7 requirements | Re-verified after gap closure (Plan 27-05) |
| 28 — Localization String Extraction | PASSED | 3/3 criteria, 3/3 requirements | Re-verified after UAT gap closure (Plans 28-11, 28-12) |
| 29 — Integration Marketplace | UNVERIFIED | —/— | No VERIFICATION.md exists. All 5 plans complete per ROADMAP. |
| 30 — Free-Form Kanban Boards | GAPS_FOUND | 16/18 truths | KANB-11 partial (entity click-to-preview). Fix in uncommitted code. |
| 31 — Quote PDF Templates | UNVERIFIED + INCOMPLETE | —/— | No VERIFICATION.md. Plan 31-05 not executed (no SUMMARY). |

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

### Localization (LOCL) — 10/10 Satisfied

| LOCL-09 | Phase 28: SATISFIED | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| LOCL-10 | Phase 28: SATISFIED | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |

### Integration Marketplace (INTG) — 0/12 Satisfied (All Orphaned)

| Requirement | VERIFICATION.md | REQUIREMENTS.md | Status |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| INTG-01 | MISSING (no 29-VERIFICATION.md) | [x] Complete | **orphaned** |
| INTG-02 | MISSING | [x] Complete | **orphaned** |
| INTG-03 | MISSING | [x] Complete | **orphaned** |
| INTG-04 | MISSING | [x] Complete | **orphaned** |

| INTG-09 | MISSING | [x] Complete | **orphaned** |
| INTG-10 | MISSING | [x] Complete | **orphaned** |
| INTG-11 | MISSING | [x] Complete | **orphaned** |
| INTG-12 | MISSING | [x] Complete | **orphaned** |

**Note:** The integration checker confirmed all 12 INTG requirements are fully wired (API routes have callers, components exist, auth guards correct). These are orphaned due to missing formal verification, not missing implementation.

### Kanban Boards (KANB) — 17/18 Satisfied

| Requirement | VERIFICATION.md | REQUIREMENTS.md | Status |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| KANB-01 | Phase 30: SATISFIED | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| KANB-02 | Phase 30: SATISFIED | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| KANB-03 | Phase 30: SATISFIED | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| KANB-04 | Phase 30: SATISFIED | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| KANB-05 | Phase 30: SATISFIED | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| KANB-06 | Phase 30: SATISFIED | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| KANB-07 | Phase 30: SATISFIED | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| KANB-08 | Phase 30: SATISFIED | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| KANB-09 | Phase 30: SATISFIED | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| KANB-10 | Phase 30: SATISFIED | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| KANB-11 | Phase 30: PARTIAL | [x] Complete | **unsatisfied** |
| KANB-12 | Phase 30: SATISFIED | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| KANB-13 | Phase 30: SATISFIED | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| KANB-14 | Phase 30: SATISFIED | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| KANB-15 | Phase 30: SATISFIED | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| KANB-16 | Phase 30: SATISFIED | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| KANB-17 | Phase 30: SATISFIED | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| KANB-18 | Phase 30: SATISFIED | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |

**KANB-11 note:** Entity badge on card face displays name + icon correctly, but click-to-preview only worked from card detail panel. Fix (`(click)="onEntityClick($event)"` with `stopPropagation()` + `PreviewSidebarStore.open()`) exists in uncommitted working tree changes. Needs commit and re-verification.

### Quote PDF Templates (QTPL) — 0/12 Satisfied (11 Orphaned, 1 Unsatisfied)

| Requirement | VERIFICATION.md | REQUIREMENTS.md | Status |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| QTPL-01 | MISSING (no 31-VERIFICATION.md) | [x] Complete | **orphaned** |
| QTPL-02 | MISSING | [x] Complete | **orphaned** |
| QTPL-03 | MISSING | [x] Complete | **orphaned** |
| QTPL-04 | MISSING | [ ] Pending | **unsatisfied** |
| QTPL-05 | MISSING | [x] Complete | **orphaned** |
| QTPL-06 | MISSING | [x] Complete | **orphaned** |
| QTPL-07 | MISSING | [x] Complete | **orphaned** |
| QTPL-08 | MISSING | [x] Complete | **orphaned** |
| QTPL-09 | MISSING | [x] Complete | **orphaned** |
| QTPL-10 | MISSING | [x] Complete | **orphaned** |
| QTPL-11 | MISSING | [x] Complete | **orphaned** |
| QTPL-12 | MISSING | [x] Complete | **orphaned** |

**QTPL-04 note:** Plan 31-05 (preview dialog, seed templates, i18n finalization) has no SUMMARY — it was never executed. The `QuoteTemplatePreviewComponent` file exists on disk but full wiring and commit evidence are absent.

## Integration Check Results

**Integration checker model:** sonnet
**Cross-phase wiring:** 47/49 exports properly connected
**API coverage:** All routes have verified callers
**Auth protection:** All routes carry intended guard level
**E2E flows:** 5/7 complete

### Integration Gaps

| Gap | Severity | Description | Requirements |
|-----|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Uncommitted KanbanCardAssignee files | High | `KanbanCardAssignee.cs`, configuration, and migration are untracked (`??` in git). Deployment without committing will fail. | KANB-07 |
| Phase 31 Plan 05 incomplete | High | `31-05-SUMMARY.md` absent. Preview dialog, seed templates, and i18n finalization not confirmed. | QTPL-04, QTPL-05 |
| Integration translations in settings scope | Medium | 41 INTG keys in `settings/en.json` instead of own `integrations/` scope. Functionally correct but violates LOCL-05 per-feature lazy-loading. | LOCL-05 |
| KANB-11 fix uncommitted | Medium | Entity badge click-to-preview fix exists in working tree but not committed. VERIFICATION.md is stale. | KANB-11 |
| Stale checklist comment | Low | `card-detail-panel.component.ts` line 522 comment contradicts actual implementation. | — |

## Tech Debt Summary

### Phase 27 — Localization Foundation
- DynamicTable `getPageRangeSummary()` returns hardcoded English strings
- Navbar `navGroups` labels are hardcoded English

### Phase 28 — Localization String Extraction
- 312 CI "unused key" warnings from dynamic key concatenation (false positives)
- Inconsistent key prefix style in template pipes vs programmatic calls

### Phase 29 — Integration Marketplace
- No VERIFICATION.md
- Integration translations co-located in settings scope

### Phase 30 — Free-Form Kanban Boards
- Stale comment in `card-detail-panel.component.ts` (says no GET checklist endpoint)
- Stale `onLabel()` hover action comment
- 30-VERIFICATION.md stale (records KANB-11 gap already fixed in working tree)

### Phase 31 — Quote PDF Templates
- No VERIFICATION.md
- Plan 31-05 not executed

### Total: 12 items across 5 phases

## Action Items

### Critical (must resolve before milestone completion)

1. **Execute Phase 31 Plan 05** — preview dialog, seed templates, i18n finalization
2. **Run Phase 29 verifier** — create 29-VERIFICATION.md for all INTG requirements
3. **Run Phase 31 verifier** — create 31-VERIFICATION.md for all QTPL requirements (after Plan 05)
4. **Commit uncommitted changes** — KANB-11 fix, KanbanCardAssignee entity/migration, board modifications
5. **Re-verify Phase 30** — update 30-VERIFICATION.md after KANB-11 commit

### Optional (tech debt)

6. Extract integration marketplace translations to own `integrations/` scope (LOCL-05 consistency)
7. Fix stale comments in card-detail-panel.component.ts and board-card.component.ts
8. Localize DynamicTable page range summary
