### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 31 (Quote PDF Templates) requires `/gsd:research-phase` before planning — Unlayer document mode and Playwright production deployment need proof-of-concept validation
- v1.2 tech debt: `any[]` types in preview-notes-tab and preview-activities-tab components (fix in Phase 27 or 28)
- v1.2 tech debt: EntityPreviewController missing Quote/Request backend handlers
