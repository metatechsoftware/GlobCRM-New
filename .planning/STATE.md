# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-20)

**Core value:** Every entity page is a dynamic, user-configurable table with rich custom fields, saved Views, and relational navigation — making GlobCRM the single workspace where teams manage all customer relationships and operational work.
**Current focus:** v1.2 Connected Experience -- Phase 26 complete (gap closure)

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table and archived in milestones/.

Recent decisions for v1.2:
- Preview sidebar must come first (other features reference its quick actions pattern)
- Tab index refactor (index-based to label-based) is prerequisite for safe Summary tab insertion
- Summary tabs use single batched aggregation endpoints (not N+1 individual calls)
- My Day has FIXED layout (user deferred configurable gridster drag-and-drop to v1.3+)
- Zero new packages needed for v1.2
- EntityTypeRegistry as pure constant map (not injectable service) for tree-shaking
- EntityName backfill via raw SQL JOINs in migration Up method
- ShowInPreview uses nullable bool on update requests for partial update semantics
- Preview endpoint uses per-type internal RBAC (no blanket policy attribute) for cross-entity access
- Activity preview checks both OwnerId and AssignedToId; Product preview skips scope check
- AppComponent uses mat-sidenav-container with mode=side for push-content preview sidebar at 480px
- Preview sidebar store uses navigation stack with max depth 10 and cap-and-trim strategy
- Feed entity links: normal click opens preview sidebar, Ctrl/Cmd+click navigates to detail page
- Feed tooltips use denormalized entityName (no API call on hover)
- Material chip hover uses CSS custom properties (--mdc-chip-elevated-container-color) not direct background
- Sidebar container below fixed header uses margin-top + calc height, not padding-top
- Entity-prefixed DTO names for summary endpoints to avoid namespace collisions (co-located per controller file)
- Win rate computed from materialized deal data, not separate SQL query
- Request summary uses dual-ownership RBAC (OwnerId + AssignedToId)
- Shared frontend summary interfaces (SummaryActivityDto etc.) instead of entity-prefixed since shapes are identical
- Computed signals for type narrowing in EntitySummaryTabComponent @switch blocks
- StageInfoDto adapter pattern for MiniStageBarComponent reuse in summary tabs
- CSS conic-gradient donut chart with radial-gradient mask for donut hole (zero-dependency chart visualization)
- Activities as hero content with full-width card and two distinct sections (Recent + Upcoming with accent border)
- Deal count for donut segment proportions (not value) for clearer visual pipeline distribution
- NoteFormComponent uses MAT_DIALOG_DATA with optional injection for dual-mode operation (standalone route and dialog)
- Quick actions call loadSummary() directly in afterClosed handler for immediate user feedback
- Quote and Request keep raw mat-tab-group with selectedIndex binding (not refactored to RelatedEntityTabsComponent)
- Summary dirty-flag set on status transitions for Quote and Request
- No Company detail changes needed for dirty-flag -- no inline sibling-tab mutations exist
- Route ordering: auth, onboarding, my-day, analytics, settings, entity routes, redirects
- Backward compat: /dashboard redirects to /analytics (not removed)
- Sequential await for all My Day EF Core queries (DbContext not thread-safe)
- Pipeline grouping in memory after Include(d => d.Stage) to avoid EF GroupBy translation issues
- RecentlyViewedEntity upsert via unique index on (tenant_id, user_id, entity_type, entity_id)
- PreviewEntityLinkComponent enhanced globally for Ctrl/Cmd+click — benefits all entity links app-wide
- Widget components use PreviewEntityLinkComponent directly for entity links rather than emitting events to parent
- Pipeline stacked bar uses CSS flex with proportional flex values per stage dealCount (zero-dependency, matching conic-gradient donut pattern)
- CDK Overlay with InjectionToken for slide-in panel config passing (not MatDialog) for full positioning control
- Global CSS for CDK overlay panel classes (outside Angular component scope)
- Silent refreshData() skips isLoading to avoid skeleton flash on post-action refresh
- Email quick action navigates to /emails?compose=true instead of opening slide-in (pragmatic for complex compose UX)
- Context-aware mutual exclusion: slide-in panel with context 'preview-sidebar' stays open alongside sidebar
- Silent refresh via refreshCurrent() skips isLoading to avoid skeleton flash after quick action in sidebar
- Quick actions excluded for Product entities in preview sidebar (read-only)
- CDK Overlay FlexibleConnectedPositionStrategy for user preview popover anchoring (matches SlideInPanelService pattern)
- forkJoin for parallel profile + stats HTTP calls in popover (independent requests, not EF Core)
- Sequential EF Core queries in activity-stats endpoint (locked DbContext pattern)
- Preview-first search: default click/Enter opens preview sidebar, Ctrl/Cmd modifier navigates to detail page
- Recently previewed takes priority over recent searches in empty search focus dropdown
- Mobile preview sidebar uses overlay mode (not side) to prevent content push-off on full-width
- Native touch events for swipe gesture (no library) with 80px horizontal threshold and 50px max vertical drift
- trackView uses EntityPreviewService (root-scoped) not MyDayService (component-scoped) to avoid NullInjectorError
- Fire-and-forget pattern for trackView matches backend feed/notification dispatch pattern
- data.name as primary entityName source with entry.entityName fallback for trackView call

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 24 needs schema design session during planning: DashboardScope enum, "create on first access" strategy for personal dashboards
- entity_name migration on feed_items: DONE (nullable column with backfill, applied via 22-01)
