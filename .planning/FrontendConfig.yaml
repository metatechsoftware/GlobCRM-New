notes:
  assumptions:
    - "Angular Material kept as UI primitives (deeply embedded in 30+ components); PrimeNG preference noted but migration not practical"
    - "Tailwind to be added alongside Angular Material for utility/layout classes, not to replace Material theming"
    - "Lucide icons (lucide-angular) to be installed; currently using Material Icons"
    - "@ngrx/signals is the established state management pattern (7 stores exist)"
    - "Angular Reactive Forms used for all form handling (built-in)"
    - "HttpClient used for data fetching (built-in)"
    - "Desktop-first responsive strategy since CRM users primarily work on desktop"
    - "Playwright to be installed for E2E testing"
    - "SSR deferred; can add @angular/ssr later when needed"
    - "Subtle motion (Angular animations already installed) for transitions and feedback"
  openQuestions:
    - "Should PrimeNG be added specifically for data tables (p-table) alongside Angular Material for other components?"
    - "Which i18n library? @angular/localize (built-in) or ngx-translate?"
